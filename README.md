 This code uses the RandomForestClassifier class from the sklearn module to train a RandomForest classifier on the breast cancer dataset.

 The fit() method is used to train the classifier on the training data, and the predict() method is used to predict the class labels of the test data.

The score() method is used to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier on the test data.
